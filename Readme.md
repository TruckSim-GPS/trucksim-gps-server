# TruckSim GPS Telemetry Server v1.0.1

A telemetry server for **Euro Truck Simulator 2** and **American Truck Simulator** that enables real-time communication between your PC and the TruckSim GPS mobile app.

This server runs in the background while you play ETS2 or ATS, allowing your mobile device to receive live truck data for GPS navigation features.

## Compatibility

**Server Version:** 1.0.1  
**Compatible with:** TruckSim GPS alpha-4 patch-1 mobile app (v0.4.1)

## How to Use

1. **Download** the latest release
2. **Run** `TruckSimGPS_Server.exe`
3. **First-time setup:** The program will:
   - Add a firewall rule to allow PC-mobile communication[.gitignore](.gitignore)
   - Auto-detect your game installations (or ask you to locate them)
   - Copy required plugins to your game folders
4. **Keep the server running** while playing ETS2/ATS
5. **Connect your mobile device:**
   - Make sure your mobile device is connected to the same network as your PC
   - Use the local network **Server IP** shown in the server window in your mobile app's connection dialog 

## Troubleshooting

You can test connectivity by opening the **Browser Test URL** on your mobile device.  
If the browser test URL doesn't open on your mobile device, check your PC's firewall settings to ensure the connection is allowed.
